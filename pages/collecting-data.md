title: Collecting Fisheries Data

Trident has focussed on two particular areas where data are required to support fisheries research and management:

+ [biological sampling](/our-work/collecting-data/sampling "biological sampling") of catches
+ developing [video observation](/our-work/collecting-data/video-observation "video observation") to supplement traditional fisheries observer programmes

Both of these areas require working with the seafood industry to develop effective procedures for collecting high quality data that meet the needs of fisheries researchers.
