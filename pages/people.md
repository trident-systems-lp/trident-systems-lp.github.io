Trident Systems is a Limited Partnership with funding for our R&D programme provided by our Limited Partners, together with co-funding from Seafood Innovations Limited. Trident Systems is governed by the Board of Trident Systems General Partner Limited.

Our R&D programme, and the delivery of stock-specific services, is undertaken in collaboration with several independent research providers and we are working with the Ministry for Primary Industries to ensure that our research makes a real contribution to the management of New Zealandâ€™s fisheries.
