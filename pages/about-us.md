Trident Systems was established in 2012 to provide high quality research
services supporting the effective and efficient management of New Zealandâ€™s
fisheries for long-term sustainable use.

Our focus is on areas where the direct involvement of the seafood industry in
the research has clear benefits.  We undertake Research and Development (R&D)
to develop innovative systems and processes, and use these to address fisheries
management information needs.
