Trident Systems was established in 2012 to provide high quality research services supporting the
effective and efficient management of New Zealandâ€™s fisheries for long-term sustainable use.

Our focus is on areas where the direct involvement of the seafood industry in the research has clear benefits.

We undertake Research and Development (R&D) to develop innovative
systems and processes, and use these to address fisheries management information needs.
