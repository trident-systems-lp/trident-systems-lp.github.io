The introduction of the majority of New Zealand’s commercial fish stocks to the QMS has acted to prevent overcapacity in the industry and has constrained exploitation rates. Catch limits should generally change in response to changing stock abundance, but the information needs for traditional approaches to stock monitoring and TAC/TACC adjustment have proved too high for many lower value stocks.

Evaluated management procedures are based around decision rules for adjusting catch limits. Through simulation testing they provide confidence that management objectives will be met, and increased certainty about information requirements and management responses.

Responsive and efficient TACC setting via evaluated management procedures has already delivered proven benefits in New Zealand’s rock lobster fisheries: this objective aims to make similar gains for lower value finfish stocks.

Our R&D programme, and the delivery of stock-specific services, is undertaken in collaboration with several independent research providers and we are working with the Ministry for Primary Industries to ensure that our research makes a real contribution to the management of New Zealand’s fisheries.
