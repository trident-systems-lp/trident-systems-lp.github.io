Max has been working as a Fisheries Analyst at Trident Systems since 2015. His work often focuses on lower information inshore fish stocks, where he provides rapid analyses for a range of stakeholders.

Max moved to Trident after completing a Masters Degree at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/), where he was part of the Ministry for Primary Industries Postgraduate Scholarship in Quantitative Fisheries Science programme. His studies examined non-linear relationships between catch-per-unit-effort and population abundance using orange roughy as a focal species.

Max has a passion for the ocean and spends most of his recreational time fishing, spearfishing and surfing.
