Trident undertakes two types of project:

Research & Development (R&D)
: R&D projects are funded by Trident's shareholders with the aim of developing innovative systems and processes that support effective and efficient management of New Zealand fisheries.  Where possible, we obtain co-funding to support shareholder investment in R&D.

Contracted research
: Trident undertakes contracted research where we apply our R&D outcomes to provide contracted stock or fishery- specific research services.  We aim to provide high-quality research at a fair price.  Margins on contracted research projects are re-invested in Trident's R&D programme.

Our R&D and contracted projects can both be categorised into three broad areas:

+ [Collecting fisheries data](/our-work/collecting-data/ "Collecting fisheries data")
+ [Using fisheries data](/our-work/using-data/ "Using fisheries data")
+ Evaluating approaches for [effective fisheries management](/our-work/effective-management/ "Effective fisheries management")
