Trident undertakes two types of project:

Research & Development (R&D)
: R&D projects are funded by Trident's shareholders with the aim of developing innovative systems and processes that support of effective and efficient management of New Zealand fisheries.  Where possible, we obtain co-funding to support shareholder investment in R&D.

Contracted research
: Applying our R&D outcomes to provide contracted stock or fishery- specific research services.

Our R&D and contracted projects can both be categorised into three broad areas:

+ [Collecting fisheries data](/our-work/collecting-data/ "Collecting fisheries data") to fisheries research
+ [Using fisheries data](/our-work/using-data/ "Using fisheries data")
+ Evaluating approaches for [effective fisheries management](/our-work/effective-management/ "Effective fisheries management")
