Trident Systems was established in 2012 to provide high quality research services supporting the effective and efficient management of New Zealandâ€™s fisheries for long-term sustainable use. Our focus is on areas where the direct involvement of the seafood industry in the research has clear benefits. We are currently undertaking a Research and Development (R&D) programme to develop innovative systems and processes, using these to address fisheries management information needs.
