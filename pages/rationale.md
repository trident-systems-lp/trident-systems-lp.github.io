### Incentives for quota owners

New Zealand's quota management system (QMS) provides strong incentives for
industry organisations to be involved in the delivery of services.

   in New Zealand\'s commercial fisheries. ITQs are a form of property right.' %}

> It is often suggested that the possession of ITQs should provide an
> incentive for fishers to exercise stewardship of the resource. Quota holders
> acting in their economic self-interest should collectively exercise
> stewardship, setting TACs and supporting enforcement measures to maximize
> the present value of future profit streams.

{% include alert warning='The importance of ITQs in fisheries management is
   not universally accepted' %}

Bromley (2009)[^3] is critical of the importance attributed to ITQs in
fisheries management (see also the comments and discussion published alongside
that paper).  However, secure property rights continue to be identified as
key components of sustainable fisheries management regimes.
Holmes et al. (2014)[^4] suggest three key enablers of sustainable and
profitable fisheries:

+ **Secure tenure** aligns the incentives and empowers the fishing industry to
  pursue sustainable use of the resource
+ **Sustainable harvests** determine how much fish can be caught sustainably and
  enable the creation of both management and investment frameworks
+ **Monitoring and enforcement** provide assurance that fishers will comply with
  sustainable management and reduce the chance of illegal activity that could
  undermine the transition

{% include alert info='The establishment of Trident Systems is an example
   of quota owners investing to provide information that contributes to the
   setting of sustainable harvests and efficient monitoring of fisheries' %}

### Purpose

Key research and information needs that motivated the establishment of Trident
Systems were:

+ the need for **efficient data collection for fisheries management**,
  especially from inshore finfish fisheries
+ a desire to **realise greater value from fisheries data**
+ a recognition of the need to **evaluate and implement management
  procedures** to enable timely management of lower information stocks

### Research integrity

The integrity of the research undertaken by the seafood industry has been
questioned by some commentators. Within New Zealand, research intended or
likely to inform fisheries management decisions is evaluated against the
**Research and Science Information Standard for New Zealand Fisheries** (RSIS).

> The primary, internationally-accepted mechanism for evaluating the quality
> of research and science information is peer review
> - Ministry for Primary Industries (2011)[^5]

The RSIS establishes peer review as the principal process used to ensure the
quality of scientific methods, results and conclusions.  As a result, the
RSIS is intrinsically an output standard enabling a range of providers,
including industry organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations, to carry
out research that is evaluated against the Standard.
