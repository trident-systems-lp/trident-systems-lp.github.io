### Rationale

New Zealand's quota management system (QMS) provides strong incentives for
industry organisations to be involved in delivery of services.

{% include alert info='The QMS establishes Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ)
   in New Zealand\'s commercial fisheries. ITQs are a form of property right.' %}

> "ITQs, with adequate enforcement, have been demonstrated to
> effectively address the race to fish and result in improved
> sustainability and profitability."
>
> "It is often suggested that the possession of ITQs should provide an
> incentive for fishers to exercise stewardship of the resource. Quota holders
> acting in their economic self-interest should collectively exercise
> stewardship, setting TACs and supporting enforcement measures to maximize
> the present value of future profit streams."
> - Parslow (2010)[^1]


> "Setting and enforcing sensible fisheries management rules is crucial for
> a good economic performance of the fishing activity.
> ...
> it is well known that governments, due to fundamental problems of information
> and incentives, tend to be inefficient providers of services in general.
> Indeed, fisheries management conducted by many governments has been
> found to be both ineffective and expensive."
>
> "under an ITQ system, the holders of ITQs are well placed to conduct the
> necessary fisheries management functions themselves. Moreover, there are
> many indications that they are able to provide these services significantly
> more efficiently than the government."
> - Arnason (2007)[^2]

{% include alert warning='The importance of ITQs in fisheries management is
   not universally accepted' %}

Bromley (2009)[^3] is critical of the importance attributed to ITQs in
fisheries management (note the comments and discussion published alongside
that paper).  However, secure property rights continue to be identified as
key components of sustainable fisheries management regimes.
Holmes et al. (2014)[^4] suggest three key enablers of sustainable and
profitable fisheries:

+ **Secure tenure** aligns the incentives and empowers the fishing industry to
  pursue sustainable use of the resource
+ **Sustainable harvests** determine how much fish can be caught sustainably and
  enable the creation of both management and investment frameworks
+ **Monitoring and enforcement** provide assurance that fishers will comply with
  sustainable management and reduce the chance of illegal activity that could
  undermine the transition
