Key characteristics of Trident's approach to fisheries research are:

+ collaboration; and
+ transparency and reproducibility.

### Collaboration

From the outset, Trident Systems has focussed on working in collaboration with
other research providers. As a result Trident has a
[small core staff](/about-us/people/ "Our people") and a wide range of
[collaborators](/about-us/partners/ "Our partners").

> "We hail individual geniuses, but success in science comes through
> collaboration
>
> Bringing people together from diverse backgrounds leads to new ways of
> thinking, better thinking and faster progress"
> - Jeremy Farrar, director, Wellcome Trust[^1]

### Transparency and reproducibility

> "Transparency and reproducibility are the beating heart of the scientific
> enterprise"
> - Chambers & Nosek (2015)[^2]

Trident aims to make fisheries data accessible and available for multiple use,
while meeting Ministry for Primary Industries guidelines on data access and
confidentiality.

We have developed systems that increase the efficiency and reproducibility of
analyses of fisheries data.
