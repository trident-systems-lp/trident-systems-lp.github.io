### Rationale

Trident Systems is a seafood industry owned research provider.  New Zealand's
quota management system (QMS) provides strong incentives for industry
organisations to be involved in delivery of services.

   in New Zealand\'s commercial fisheries. ITQs are a form of property right' %}

> "It is often suggested that the possession of ITQs should provide an
> incentive for fishers to exercise stewardship of the resource. Quota holders
> acting in their economic self-interest should collectively exercise
> stewardship, setting TACs and supporting enforcement measures to maximize
> the present value of future profit streams."
> - Parslow (2010)[^1]
