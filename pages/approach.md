### Rationale

New Zealand's quota management system (QMS) provides strong incentives for
industry organisations to be involved in delivery of services.

{% include alert info='The QMS establishes Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ)
   in New Zealand\'s commercial fisheries. ITQs are a form of property right.' %}

> "ITQs, with adequate enforcement, have been demonstrated to
> effectively address the race to fish and result in improved
> sustainability and profitability."
>
> "It is often suggested that the possession of ITQs should provide an
> incentive for fishers to exercise stewardship of the resource. Quota holders
> acting in their economic self-interest should collectively exercise
> stewardship, setting TACs and supporting enforcement measures to maximize
> the present value of future profit streams."
> - Parslow (2010)[^1]


> "Setting and enforcing sensible fisheries management rules is crucial for
> a good economic performance of the fishing activity.
> ...
> it is well known that governments, due to fundamental problems of information
> and incentives, tend to be inefficient providers of services in general.
> Indeed, fisheries management conducted by many governments has been
> found to be both ineffective and expensive."
>
> "under an ITQ system, the holders of ITQs are well placed to conduct the
> necessary fisheries management functions themselves. Moreover, there are
> many indications that they are able to provide these services significantly
> more efficiently than the government."
> - Arnason (2007)[^2]
