Trident Systems is formally a Limited Partnership, and collaboration with other research providers is a key aspect of how we work.  

### Our Industry Partners

The Limited Partners in the Trident Systems Limited Partnership are quota owners who have decided to invest in R&D as part of their strategy to maintain the long-term value of their quota assets.

Trident's Limited Partners represent a significant proportion of quota in inshore finfish and deepwater "tier 2" stocks.  These are lower information stocks, the management of which is expected to benefit most from Trident's research.

Our Limited Partners are:
