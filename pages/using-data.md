New Zealand's commercial fisheries are data rich, but - due to restrictions on data access - these data are often under-used.

Trident has developed systems that aim to make existing fisheries data more accessible, both to the public and to researchers, while complying with the Ministry for Primary Industries' data confidentiality rules and guidelines.

        <li>provides a comprehensive, graphical characterisation of New Zealand's fisheries using the Ministry for Primary Industries' statutory catch, effort, and landings data</li>
        <li>gives rapid insight into the structure and trends of most New Zealand fisheries and so allows users to gain insights without having to request data from the Ministry</li>
        <li>is updated annually</li>
