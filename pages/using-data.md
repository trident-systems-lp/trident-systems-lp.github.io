New Zealand's commercial fisheries are data rich, but these data can be hard to access and interpret, and so are under-used.

Trident has developed systems that aim to make existing fisheries data more accessible, both to the public and to researchers, while complying with the Ministry for Primary Industries' data confidentiality rules and guidelines.
