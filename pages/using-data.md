New Zealandâ€™s commercial fisheries are data rich, but these data are often under used. This workstream aims to better use existing data. It will support the regular operation of management procedures, and of sampling programmes.

We will also provide annually updated, semi-automated, fisheries characterisations that provide graphical summaries of catch, effort, and landings data at a variety of levels. Such characterisations provide a rapid insight into trends in a fishery, without the need for a specific research project. They support efficient management, and provide context for developing management procedures and sampling programmes.
